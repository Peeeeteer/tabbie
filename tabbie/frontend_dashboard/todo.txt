Todo Page
- Decide better way to add and delete catogires
-> There was something if all is deleted reset, but this bad and need to complety redo this

- The create task tab is now over and doesnt push the actual todos

- Under individual task, we see how many pomodors (long we have tracked and tried to do it), like spend 3h doing this

- Update colors for need to do, sooner, late and such? (Make page responsive)


- This todo has steps button? When pressed we devide into task into like 5 other, with description still
and htis updates also in teh pomodoro with the tasks cycles

- In the task description, we add pomodoros and how many finished and such and progress and things, with connections for each


- Imoprove the smoothness/animation of when rearranging the todos and hovering while dragging, so that yea its smoother and cooler

Also could the transition of the tasks from one place to another be even smoother and cooler feeling, where it kinda slides down
