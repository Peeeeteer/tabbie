# 🤖 tabbie

**An open-source desk robot with a screen, a voice — and a personality.**

Currently... I still suck at this and not much works...but I'm building it piece by piece, and sharing everything I learn along the way

## 🛠️ What Is Tabbie?

Tabbie is your little desk assistant — a cute robot that watches, listens, speaks, and helps.
Basicly your own little twitch streamer in the corner doing faces


Tabbie connects to a [Tabbie.me website](./website) — or your own self-hosted version — where you can:
- Talk to you using voice + face expressions 🎙️
- Help you with your day:
  - ✅ Manage a to-do list (Pomodoro thing)
  - 🗓️ Show your upcoming schedule
  - 📄 Even read documents out loud
- Sync things between the site and the robot (todolist)
- Eventually: customize personality, expressions, and voice and much more...

It’s like if your little small robot assistant

## 🧠  Learning Progress so far / [Roadmap](./learnings/index.md)

I havent built it yet and I'm still learning on how to make Tabbie,  
Here’s the latest entry from my devlog 

> **🧪 01 - Arduino Uno Basics**  
> Learned how to blink an LED, Turn Servo with a potantioni... how ever you write that  
> [📖 Read full log →](./learnings/01-arduino-uno-basic/README.md)

I’ll keep updating this as I go.   
Expect bad wiring, writing, dumb bugs... but it will work eventually
