# 🤖 tabbie

**An open-source desk robot with a screen, a voice, a camera — and a personality.**

Currently... I still suck at this and not much works...but I'm building it piece by piece, and sharing everything I learn along the way

## 🛠️ What Is Tabbie?

Tabbie is your little desk assistant — a screen-faced robot that watches, listens, speaks, and helps.

It’s designed to:
- Basicly your own little twitch streamer in the corner doing faces
- Talk to you using voice + LCD expressions 🎙️
- Help you with your day:
  - ✅ Manage a to-do list
  - 🗓️ Show your upcoming schedule
  - 📄 Even read documents out loud

Tabbie connects to a [Next.js-based website](./website) — or your own self-hosted version — where you can:
- Add/edit tasks and calendar events
- Sync things between the site and the robot
- Eventually: customize personality, expressions, and voice
- Hopefully more stuff later

It’s like if your planner had a face and liked hanging out with you.
