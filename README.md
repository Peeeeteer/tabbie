## 🛠️ What Is Tabbie?

Tabbie is your little desk assistant — a cute robot that watches, listens, speaks, and helps.

It’s designed to:
- Basicly your own little twitch streamer in the corner doing faces
- Talk to you using voice + face expressions 🎙️
- Help you with your day:
  - ✅ Manage a to-do list (Pomodoro thing)
  - 🗓️ Show your upcoming schedule
  - 📄 Even read documents out loud

Tabbie connects to a [Tabbie.me website](./website) — or your own self-hosted version — where you can:
- Add/edit tasks and calendar events
- Sync things between the site and the robot
- Eventually: customize personality, expressions, and voice
- Upload,Read And Find docs,images,invoices etc..
- Hopefully more stuff later

It’s like if your little small robot assistant
