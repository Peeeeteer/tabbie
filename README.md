## 🧠 What is Tabbie?

**Tabbie is a learning kit disguised as a cute robot.**  
It’s a full hands-on project where **software meets hardware** — made for coders who’ve never touched a breadboard.

By the end, you’ll have:
- 🖥️ A React dashboard talking to real-world hardware  
- 🔌 An ESP32-based robot with a screen, sound, and servos  
- 🧠 A beginner-to-intermediate grasp of microcontrollers and electronics



## 🤖 What Can Tabbie Do?

Once built, your Tabbie will be able to:

- 😋 Do funny faces, move and be fun
- ✅ Display and manage your to-do list  
- ⏲️ Run Pomodoro timers like “Start pomodoro for [task]”  
- 🔔 Set reminders (e.g., “Drink water every 30 mins”)  
- 🗣️ Talk to you with sound + facial expressions _(in the future)_

It’s like your making own tiny Twitch streamer, habbit tracker and digital desk buddy.


## ❓ Why Build Tabbie?

You could follow another “LED blink” tutorial...  
**Or you could build a robot with a screen, voice, arms — and a personality.**

- 🎓 Actually learn electronics by building something cool  
- 💬 Understand how software connects to the real world  
- 🤖 Give your desk a quirky assistant that makes you look at your phone less
- 🧪 Experiment, break stuff, and learn by doing  
- ✨ Walk away with something you *actually* made


## 🚀 Get Started

So you’re ready to build your own Tabbie? Noice.   
Whether you want to buy the official kit or DIY it from scratch — you’re covered.

An open-source robot kit powered by an ESP32 and controlled via a local React dashboard — made to teach developers hardware from scratch, by building something real.
**The desk robot that teaches you electronics — one LED, servo, and silly face at a time.**
