## 🛠️ What Is Tabbie?

Tabbie is your little desk assistant — a cute robot that watches, listens, speaks, and helps.
Basicly your own little twitch streamer in the corner doing faces


Tabbie connects to a [Tabbie.me website](./website) — or your own self-hosted version — where you can:
- Talk to you using voice + face expressions 🎙️
- Help you with your day:

- Eventually: customize personality, expressions, and voice and much more...

It’s like if your little small robot assistant
